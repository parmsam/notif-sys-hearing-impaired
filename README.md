# Open Source Notification System for the Hearing Impaired

## Motivation
Hearing impaired individuals commonly use alerting devices for notification of an event taking place (a doorbell, a telephone, or alarm). [1,2] The landscape of alerting devices to notify hearing impaired individuals is expensive and has had seemingly limited attention from the open source community thus far. [3-5] Here we propose an open source notification box built around a Raspberry Pi to notify a hearing impaired individual of trigger sounds such as a baby crying or doorbell ringing in their surrounding environment, with build instructions made publicly available

## Materials
